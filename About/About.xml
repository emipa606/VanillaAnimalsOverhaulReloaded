Updated for 1.1 by Mitz

--- Original Description ---
I have updated this mod further for RimWorld v1.0, upon seeing that Ludeon user "Caffeine Zombie" took the first and largest step to updating. A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals. Horns, pack animals, and Thrumbo upgrades.


Original Mod Author's words and my updates can be found in the "Change Notes" linked here.
